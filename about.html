    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <div class="aboutMe">
        <p>I am a student pursuing a degree in Computer Science who is passionate 
        about solving problems and learning the newest technologies. I am currently 
        an Associate Software Engineer at Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories. 
        I love to travel with my husband and three dogs in our converted van 
        throughout the United States. Glacier National Park has been my favorite spot so far!</p>
