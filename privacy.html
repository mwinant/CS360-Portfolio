        <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

        <p>
            Mikayla Winant values your privacy. This policy explains how personal information collected 
            through this website is used and protected.
        </p>

        <h2>Information Collection</h2>
        <p>
            We may collect information such as your name and email address when you submit forms on the 
            website, including the Sign In or Sign Up forms. This information is used solely for the purpose 
            of providing services or responding to inquiries.
        </p>

        <h2>Use of Information</h2>
        <p>
            Collected information is used only to improve the website experience, respond to messages, or 
            manage accounts. Your data will not be sold, shared, or rented to third parties.
        </p>

        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>
            The website may use cookies to improve functionality and user experience. Cookies are small 
            files stored on your device that help the website remember preferences. You can disable cookies 
            in your browser settings, though some features may not work properly.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            Reasonable measures are taken to protect personal information from unauthorized access or 
            disclosure. However, no online system is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Links</h2>
        <p>
            The website may contain links to third-party websites. Mikayla Winant is not responsible for 
            the privacy practices or content of these sites.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            This policy may be updated from time to time without notice. Please review this page periodically 
            for updates.
